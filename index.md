## about me

i grew up in a small town inÂ [north rhein-westphalia]. after dropping out of high school ([gymnasium]), i attended technical college and completed a three-year training as a state-certified information technology assistant. currently i am working for a big international it company in the hague in the netherlands. 

i have a background in java development and i am quite good and hacking things together in bassh, batch, powershell or python. my current day job involes writing java code and handling lots of data in hundreds of excel spreadsheets. i do not really have a specific hobby but i like to mess around with things on the web, playing games and learning new stuff.
